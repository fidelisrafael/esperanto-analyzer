This class represent the smallest unit with pratical meaning of one language. The function
of one word is to describe parts of humans thoughts, so its one unit of human language.

What's an Word?
===

A unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or their written representation,
that functions as a principal carrier of meaning.

Words are composed of one or more morphemes and are either the smallest units susceptible of
independent use or consist of two or three such units combined under certain linking conditions,
as with the loss of primary accent that distinguishes black路bird路 from black路 bird路.

Words are usually separated by spaces in writing, and are distinguished phonologically,
as by accent, in many languages.

Technically one word is one set of "Letters"
